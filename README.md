# Laplacians.jl
Laplacians is a package containing graph algorithms, with an emphsasis on tasks related to spectral and algebraic graph theory. It contains (and will contain more) code for solving systems of linear equations in graph Laplacians, low stretch spanning trees, sparsifiation, clustering, local clustering, and optimization on graphs.

All graphs are represented by sparse adjacency matrices. This is both for speed, and because our main concerns are algebraic tasks. It does not handle dynamic graphs. It would be very slow to implement dynamic graphs this way.

_Most of this package is not ready for use. The routines that are ready are the graph generators (chimera and wtedChimera), and the routines for computing the stretch of spanning trees.  As soon as we release the package, we expect to discover that many things are broken._

The documentation may be found in

This includes instructions for installing Julia, and some tips for how to start using it.  It also includes guidelines for Dan Spielman's collaborators.
