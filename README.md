The documentation may be found in
[site/about/index.html](site/about/index.html).

The documentation was produced using mkdocs, which may be found at [http://www.mkdocs.org/](http://www.mkdocs.org/).  The instructions to mkdocs say that you should not put the site subtree into git, for some reason that I don't quite understand.  So, I have put it there anyway.  We can figure out if there is a better way to do it later.
