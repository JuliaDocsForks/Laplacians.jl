  s is a set of starting vertices, phi is a constant in (0, 1], and b is an integer in [1, [log m]]

  phi is a bound on the quality of the conductance of the cut - the smaller the p, the higher the quality
  b is used to handle precision throughout the algorithm - the higher the b, the smaller the eps
