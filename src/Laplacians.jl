"""A package for graph computations related to graph Laplacians

Graphs are represented by sparse adjacency matrices, etc.
"""
module Laplacians

#=

Started by Dan Spielman.
Other contributors:


This represents graphs as sparse adjacency matrices.
The reasons are twofold:
  # 1. It is much faster than the Graphs.jl library, and
  # 2. It is more compatible with linear algebraic operations

This module begins by importing the packages it requires.
It then defines a few functions for dealing with the graphs:
deg(graph, node),  nbri(graph, node, i)  and weighti(graph, node i).
Using these is slower than what we actually do in the code.
But, you can start with this and then convert.

This then includes code from other files,
and exports the functions for which it seems appropriate.

    end

    if !isdefined(Main, :LAPLACIANS_NOAMG)
        eval(Expr(:using, :PyAMG))
