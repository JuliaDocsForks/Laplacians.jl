# About Laplacians.jl

Laplacians is a package containing graph algorithms, with an emphsasis on tasks related to spectral and algebraic graph theory.  It contains (and will contain more) code for solving systems of linear equations in graph Laplacians, low stretch spanning trees, sparsifiation, clustering, local clustering, and optimization on graphs.

All graphs are represented by sparse adjacency matrices.
This is both for speed, and because our main concerns are algebraic tasks.  it does _not_ handle dynamic graphs.  It would be very slow to implement dynamic graphs this way.

Laplacians.jl was started by Daniel A. Spielman.  Other contributors include Xiao Shi, Serban Stan and Jackson Thea.
