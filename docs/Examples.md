# Examples

The following are links to html files of Julia notebooks.
These notebooks are also in the notebook directory, and can be open there so that you can run the code live.

* [FirstNotebook](../docs/FirstNotebook.html)
* [Solvers](../docs/Solvers.html)
* [Sampler](../docs/Sampler.html)
* [LightGraphs](../docs/LightGraphs.html) - an example, with a speed test, of using LightGraphs.  At least it is easy.
